# sports-predict
This is a project that will use python and machine learning (ML) to generate a prediction model for sporting events. First iteration will be mainly just NFL score predictions, along with if teams will cover the spread and whether the over of under will hit. Further iterations will include other sports and potentially player prop projections.
